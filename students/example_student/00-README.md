# Student McStudentFace

This directory serves as an example for a student's classwork directory.

It is named with a "00" at the beginning to force it to top of file
listings. This is for our organizational purposes, and your ease of use for
this course.

Each student will create their own, similar directory, and then use it to manage
their classwork using git and [a workflow explained in our
resources](https://github.com/UWPCE-PythonCert/PythonCertDevel/blob/master/source/modules/GitWorkflow.rst).
Their work will be submitted it to the instructors for review.
